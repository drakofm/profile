        <p class='tribute-info-text'>Hayao Miyazaki was born in 1941 in Tokyo. At that time, his father was the director of “Miyazaki Airplane”, a factory that manufactured parts for the A6M Zero aircraft, which served as one of the milestones in the formation of Hayao’s creative path: his love for aircraft is often subsequently reflected in his works. Due to the specific nature of his father’s work during the realities of the war, as well as due to the serious illness of his mother, who suffered from spinal tuberculosis, the Miyazaki family often moved from place to place. While spending time caring for his mother, Hayao Miyazaki began to become interested in literature and manga, and he got a dream of becoming a mangaka. </p>
        <p class='tribute-info-text'>Hayao Miyazaki's first steps as an artist were associated with a creative crisis – he destroyed many of his first works, considering their style insufficiently original, and drawing people was difficult for him due to the fact that for many years he painted mainly enginery. </p>
        <p class='tribute-info-text'>In 1958, while in high school, Hayao saw the animated film “Hakujaden” in the cinema. In his own words, it was from that moment that he firmly decided to become an animator. After graduating from university, Hayao got a job as a phaser at Toei Animation in 1963. Over time, doubts arose about the correctness of his choice of path, but in 1964, after watching the Soviet animated film “The Snow Queen” inspiration returned to the future master, strengthening his intention to engage in animation. After working as a phaser for several years, Hayao Miyazaki was finally promoted to the position of animator. </p>
        <p class='tribute-info-text'>For more than twenty years, Hayao Miyazaki worked in several animation studios, and in 1985 he became one of the creators of the famous Studio Ghibli, which still exists today under the creative direction of the now 83-year-old master.</p>
